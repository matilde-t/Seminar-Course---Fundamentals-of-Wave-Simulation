% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
	\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
	% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
	% \graphicspath{{./Code/}{.}}
	% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
	% every instance of \includegraphics
	\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png,.jpg}
\else
	% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
	% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
	% driver is specified.
	% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
	% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
	% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
	% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
	% every instance of \includegraphics
	% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment for describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
	\usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
	\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\section{From Conservation Laws to Balance Laws}
\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper, we examine some numerical methods for the solution of \textit{non homogeneous balance laws}. These are an extension of the well-known \textit{conservation laws} of the form $q_t+f(q)_x=0$ by adding a \textit{source term} $\psi(q)$. This is called source term even if physically it represents a sink rather than a source, i.e. a loss of $q$. Our reference equation is therefore

\begin{equation} \label{eq:template}
	q_t + f(q)_x = \psi(q).
\end{equation}

We will mostly study problems where the homogeneous equation

\begin{equation} \label{eq:hom}
	q_t +f(q)_x = 0
\end{equation}

is \textit{hyperbolic} and the source terms don't depend on derivatives of $q$, so that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:source}
	q_t = \psi(q)
\end{equation}

is an independent system of ODEs.

% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Godunov-Strang splitting}

One standard approach to these problems is using a \textit{fractional-step} or \textit{operator-splitting} method, where we alternate between solving the homogeneous \eqref{eq:hom} and source \eqref{eq:source} term. This allows us to easily use many standard numerical methods for PDEs and ODEs.

\subsection{The Advection-Reaction Equation}

The standard example that will be used to illustrate all the following numerical methods is the \textit{advection-reaction} equation, which can be seen as the model for the transport along a flow of a radioactive substance which decays at rate $\beta$ while it's transported at constant speed $\bar{u}$, with initial conditions $q(x,0)= \mathring{q}(x)$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:advec}
	q_t + \bar{u}q_x=-\beta q
\end{equation}

We can compute the exact solution of \eqref{eq:advec}, because along the characteristic $\frac{dx}{dt}=\bar{u}$ we have $\frac{dq}{dt}=-\beta q$ and it follows that

\begin{equation}\label{eq:advec_sol}
	q(x,t) = e^{-\beta t}\mathring{q}(x-\bar{u}t).
\end{equation}

In Figure \ref{fig:exact}, we can see the evolution of the solution for different time steps: we notice the characteristic transport of the initial data $\mathring{q}$ at constant speed $\bar{u}$, typical of hyperbolic equations, combined with a decrease in the concentration of the substance at rate $\beta$ due to the source term.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Advection.png}
	% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
	% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
	% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
	\caption{Evolution of the exact solution of the advection-reaction equation with $\bar{u}=1$, $\beta=1$, and $\mathring{q}=\text{Gaussian}(0.25,0.003)$. We see that the maximum point decreases in time.}
	\label{fig:exact}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Unsplit Method}

Of course for this specific example we can easily compute an \textit{unsplit} method

\begin{equation}\label{eq:unsplit}
	\frac{Q^{n+1}_i-Q^n_i}{\d t} = -\bar{u} \frac{Q^n_i-Q^n_{i-1}}{\d x}-\beta Q^n_i \Rightarrow Q^{n+1}_i = Q^n_i-\bar{u} \frac{\d t}{\d x}(Q^n_i-Q^n_{i-1})-\d t\beta Q^n_i
\end{equation}

which is first-order accurate and stable for $0<\bar{u}\frac{\d t}{\d x}\leq1$.
A second-order method is also easily obtainable with the Taylor expansion of $q(x,t+\d t)$ as explained in \cite{leveque}. An important thing to note is that the full Taylor expansion of \eqref{eq:advec} can be written formally as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sol_op}
	e^{-\d t(\bar{u}\partial_x+\beta)}q(x,t):=q(x,t+\d t)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{(\d t)^j}{j!}\partial_t^jq(x,t)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{(\d t)^j}{j!}(-\bar{u}\partial_x-\beta)^jq(x,t).
\end{equation}

The operator $e^{-\d t(\bar{u}\partial_x+\beta)}$ is called \textit{solution operator} for the equation \eqref{eq:advec} over a time step of length $\d t$.

\subsection{Godunov Splitting}

In the case of the advection equation, we can split it into two subproblems:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:probA}
	\text{Problem A: } q_t+\bar{u}q_x=0,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:probB}
	\text{Problem B: } q_t = -\beta q.
\end{equation}

The idea is to solve the two problems in an alternating manner, using standard solving stategies, e.g.:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stepA}
	\text{A-step: } Q_i^* = Q_i^n - \frac{\bar{u}\d t}{\d x} (Q_i^n-Q_{i-1}^n),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stepB}
	\text{B-step: } Q_i^{n+1} = Q_i^*-\beta\d tQ_i^*.
\end{equation}

This method is known as \textit{Godunov splitting}, also called Lie-Trotter splitting (mostly outside the Finite Volume setting).

One may think that given that both $Q_i^*$ and $Q_i^{n+1}$ are calculated using $\d t$, the solution is valid for time $2\d t$, but it is not really the case: in fact if we combine the two stages and eliminate $Q_i^*$, as detailed in \cite{leveque}, we obtain

\begin{equation}
	Q_i^{n+1} = Q_i^n -\frac{\bar{u}\d t}{\d x}(Q_i^n-Q_{i-1}^n)-\beta\d tQ_i^n +\frac{\bar{u}\beta\d t^2}{\d x}(Q_i^n-Q_{i-1}^n).
\end{equation}

The first three terms on the right hand side agree with \eqref{eq:unsplit} and the last one is $\mathcal{O}(\d t^2)$, so this method is also consistent and first-order accurate. A question that may arise is: does the accuracy improve if we use a second-order method for both \eqref{eq:probA} and \eqref{eq:probB}? In this specific case, yes, but it is not true in general because the splitting introduces a $\mathcal{O}(\d t)$ error. The reason why we don't have an error in this case is that we can really decouple the advection and the decay and do these updates in either order. This doesn't happen anymore if for example we take $\beta = 1-x$, because in this case the value depends on the position and applying the B-step before or after the A-step changes the result. We say that the two subproblems \textit{commute} if there is no splitting error.

This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:AB}, where we compare the case $\beta=1$ and $\beta=1-x$. The error is small and one needs a very coarse approximation to show it clearly. This is the reason why the numerical solution seems so far from the analytical solution.

\subsection{General Formulation}

To better understand the commuting property, we consider the more general formulation

\begin{equation}
	q_t = (\ca+\cb)q
\end{equation}

where $\ca$ and $\cb$ can be differential operators, such as $-\bar{u}\partial_x$ and $-\beta(x)$ in the case of the advection-reaction equation. To simplify the calculations, we assume that they don't explicitly depend on $t$, so that we can write

\begin{equation}
	q_{tt} = (\ca+\cb)q_t=(\ca+\cb)^2q
\end{equation}

without having to take care of the chain rule. If we Taylor expand the solution at time $t$ and use the notation defined in \eqref{eq:sol_op}, we easily get to

\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp_unsplit}
	q(x,\d t) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{\d t^j}{j!}(\ca + \cb)^jq(x,0) = e^{\d t(\ca +\cb)}q(x,0).
\end{equation}

With Godunov splitting, we obtain

\begin{equation}
	q^*(x,\d t)=e^{\d t \ca}q(x,0)
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
	q^{**}(x,\d t)=e^{\d t \cb}q^*(x,\d t) = e^{\d t \cb}e^{\d t \ca}q(x,0).
\end{equation}

The splitting error is then

\begin{equation}
	q(x,\d t)-q^{**}(x,\d t) = (e^{\d t(\ca +\cb)}-e^{\d t \cb}e^{\d t \ca})q(x,0).
\end{equation}

If we expand $q^{**}$, we obtain

\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp_split}
	q^{**}(x,\d t) = (I+\d t(\ca + \cb)+\frac{1}{2}\d t^2(\ca^2+2\cb\ca+\cb^2)+\dots)q(x,0).
\end{equation}

It is fundamental to note that in the $\d t^2$ term, in \eqref{eq:exp_unsplit} we have $(\ca +\cb)^2=(\ca +\cb)(\ca +\cb)=\ca^2+\ca\cb+\cb\ca+\cb^2$, which in general is \textit{not} the same as the $(\ca^2+2\cb\ca+\cb^2)$ term that we have in \eqref{eq:exp_split}. We can clearly see now how there is no splitting error only if $\ca\cb=\cb\ca$, that is, if the operators commute. This means that if it is not the case, the Godunov method can only ever be first-order accurate, due to the splitting error.

\subsection{Strang Splitting}

Fortunately, there is an easy way to overcome the first-order limitation of the Godunov splitting and offer second-order accuracy in most cases. It is called \textit{Strang splitting} and the idea is to solve $q_t=\ca q$ over $\frac{\d t}{2}$ at first, then use the result to do a full time step on $q_t=\cb q$, and then complete the iteration with the remaining half time step on $q_t=\ca q$. Of course it works if we swap $\ca$ and $\cb$ too. This means that this time we are approximating $e^{\d t(\ca +\cb)}$ by $e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}$. The Taylor expansion shows in fact that

\begin{equation}
	e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca} = I+\d t(\ca + \cb)+\frac{1}{2}\d t^2(\ca^2+\ca\cb+\cb\ca+\cb^2)+\mathcal{O}(\d t^3),
\end{equation}

so this method correctly captures the equation. We can note that after $n$ time steps we obtain

\begin{equation}\label{eq:recursion}
	Q^n = \underbrace{(e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca})(e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca})\dots(e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca})}_{n\text{ times}}Q^0.
\end{equation}

Given that $e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca}e^{\frac{1}{2}\d t\ca} = e^{\d t\ca}$, we see that this method differs from the Godunov one only in the fact that we start and end with a half time step on $\ca$. Another way of obtaining the same result is by alternating the oder of application of $\ca$ and $\cb$, in each time step, i.e.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{gathered}
		Q^1 = e^{\d t\ca}e^{\d t\cb}Q^0\\
		Q^2 = e^{\d t\cb}e^{\d t\ca}Q^1\\
		\vdots
	\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Analogously to our analysis of \eqref{eq:recursion}, we can see that the result is essentially the same, but with $\d t$ instead of $\frac{1}{2}\d t$. This is computationally better because it requires fewer function evaluations, but it is more difficult to implement with variable time steps. Furthermore, it needs an even number of iterations in order to obtain the desired cancellation of errors.

\subsection{Accuracy}

We tried to replicate some results from \cite{leveque}, but as the author says, for this specific problem the Godunov splitting is essentially as accurate as the Strang splitting. We decided to try with a completely different type of problem, namely the \textit{logistic equation} in the form

\begin{equation}
	u' = u-u^2\quad,\qquad u(0)=0.1
\end{equation}

with solution $u(t)=(9e^{-t}+1)^{-1}$ \cite{logistic}. Both subproblems, $u'=u$ and $u'=-u^{2}$, have been discretised with a forward Euler step.

The results show a similar behaviour. The two operators do not commute and in fact we see in Figure \ref{fig:err} and \ref{fig:AccuracyLogistic} that Godunov usually overestimates or underestimates compared to Strang. In this case, one of the two Godunov versions behaves better, probably because of the difference in magnitude between $u$ and $u^2$.

\section{Implicit methods and choice of ODE solver}\label{sec:implicit}

In the case of Godunov splitting, we want to use a second-order accurate method in order to maintain the right accuracy. However, in general we cannot use multistep methods that require more than one level of data, because we only have $Q_i^*$ to use to compute $Q_i^{n+1}$. Values of $Q_i^*$ from previous time steps cannot be used because they are computed by solving a different problem, which is not our ODE. Runge-Kutta methods are very useful because they calculate their own intermediate values to construct higher-order approximations. For explicit methods, we need to make sure that the method is stable with the used time step.

If the ODE $q_t=\psi(q)$ is \textit{stiff} (i.e. such that an extremely small time step is required to solve it with an explicit numerical method), as detailed in Section \ref{sec:stiff}, then an implicit method is needed. The usual choice is the trapezoidal rule:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:trapezoidal}
	Q_i^{n+1} = Q_i^*+\frac{\d t}{2}[\psi(Q_i^*)+\psi(Q_i^{n+1})].
\end{equation}

Another nice property of the split methods is that they only require the ODE part to be solved implicitly: the hyperbolic part can still be solved with explicit methods.

If $\psi$ depends on derivatives of $q$, these need to be discretised. For example, if $\psi(q)=\mu q_{xx}$, then \eqref{eq:trapezoidal} becomes the Crank-Nicolson method and requires solving a tridiagonal system.

\section{Stiff and singular source terms and the associated numerical difficulties} \label{sec:stiff}

The last consideration of this paper is about stiffness and singularity for source terms. Sometimes it happens that the source term is not distributed in space, but rather behaves like a delta function, i.e. is very large only on a small region compared to our domain. This is the case for example for chemical reactions that can happen on very different time scales compared to the fluid dynamic one. If the reaction zone is concentrated, this source term is called \textit{stiff} in analogy with the the ODEs. Another typical example of stiff reacting flow is the \textit{detonation wave}: an explosion where a gas burns in a thin reaction zone and gets propagated in the rest of the gas like a shock wave. The thin reaction zone can be modeled as a delta function.

We can say that the solution is evolving on a \textit{slow manifold} in state space and perturbing the solution causes it to produce a rapid transient response followed again by a slow evolution. A very simple example is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stiff}
	u'(t)=-\frac{u(t)}{\tau}
\end{equation}

where of course $u\equiv0$ is the slow manifold. Solving stiff hyperbolic equations is even more difficult than solving stiff ODEs, because the fastest reactions are \textit{not} in equilibrium everywhere: for example in a detonation wave, the wave travels through space, so we cannot concentrate our efforts on a specific area of the domain. For some problems the only solution is using an adaptive mesh refinement whereas in other cases using implicit methods may be enough thanks to their good stability properties. As we saw in Section \ref{sec:implicit}, a problem with splitting methods and stiff ODEs is that we cannot use previous time steps, so we are limited in the choice of our solver. The trapezoidal rule seems to work fine for ODEs, but fails for hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms. If we consider \eqref{eq:stiff}, the trapezoidal methods yields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:amplification}
	U^{n+1} = \left(\frac{1-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\d t}{\tau}}{1+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\d t}{\tau}}\right)U^*.
\end{equation}

If we start on the slow manifold, in this case $U^*=0$, then $U^{n+1}=0$ and we remain in the slow manifold. In any other case, if $-\frac{\d t}{\tau}\rightarrow-\infty$, then $U^{n+1}=-U^*$ and this means that the coefficient in \eqref{eq:amplification} makes the solution oscillate in time rather than decay as we would expect. It is due to the fact that the trapezoidal rule is an \textit{A-stable} method. In fact, the stability region is the left half plane, but the problem is that the stability function doesn't approach zero everywhere as the step size goes to infinity \cite{Byron}. That's what causes the oscillatory behaviour. We need an \textit{L-stable} method, where the point at infinity is inside the stability region and so the coefficient approaches a value less than $1$ in magnitude. The BDF (Backward Differentiation Formulas) methods have this characteristic and the simplest one is the backward Euler method. In fact for \eqref{eq:stiff}

\begin{equation}
	U^{n+1}=U^*-\frac{\d t}{\tau}U^{n+1}\Rightarrow U^{n+1} = \left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{\d t}{\tau}}\right)U^*.
\end{equation}

We note that this time the coefficient approaches zero for $\frac{\d t }{\tau}\rightarrow\infty$. However, the implicit Euler method is only first-order accurate. If we want a second-order, one-step method, a choice can be the TR-BDF2 method. One can find more information in \cite{leveque}.

In Figure \ref{fig:stability}, we can see that in fact as the distance from the origin increases, for the implicit Euler method all the points become stable, whereas in the trapezoidal rule case the points in the right half plane will never become stable.
