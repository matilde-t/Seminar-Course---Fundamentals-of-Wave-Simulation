\maketitle

\section{Summary of paper}
Give a short (roughly 1/4 page) summary of your understanding of the paper.

\section{Review}
Give a review of the paper. This should first discuss the overall structure and the quality of the work.

Afterwards, discuss things that are not optimal on a section-by-section basis.
The focus should here be on the quality of the exposition and content; and not on grammatical or typographical errors.
Of course, if you notice them you should include them in the review.
Here, there is no strict page limit but it is typically not shorter than 1/2 page (unless it is really perfect) and not longer than 3/2 pages.
